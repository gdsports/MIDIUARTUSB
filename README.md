# MIDI UART USB converter

Bi-directional converter between MIDI USB and MIDI UART. There are many pages
that describe how to connect a UART port to DIN connectors so it is not covered
here.

Maximum System Exclusive size is 1024 bytes.

Tested in 32u4 boards such as Arduino Leonardo, SparkFun Pro Micro, and Adafuit
Itsy Bitsy.

Install MIDI Library and MIDIUSB libraries.

Tested on Arduino Zero and Adafruit Trinket M0. It might work on other SAMD21
boards.
